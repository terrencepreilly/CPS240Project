Here is a list of features we have yet to implement:
	* Main Menu
	* Bot flagging option
	* Animations
	* Character actions
		- Killing opponents
		- Losing health
	* Sound
	* Networking
		- In order to implement multiple connections, the server must
		use threading.  This makes a separate, enemy-handling client
		unnecessary. Though it still may be easier, and cleaner.
		A problem with multiple threads is that they must all update
		gamestate.  GameState, then, must be synchronized, and use
		only syncronized data types.
